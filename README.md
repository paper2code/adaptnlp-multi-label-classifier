## AdaptNLP

AdaptNLP allows users ranging from beginner python coders to experienced machine learning engineers to leverage
state-of-the-art NLP models and training techniques in one easy-to-use python package.

Built atop Zalando Research's Flair and Hugging Face's Transformers library, AdaptNLP provides Machine
Learning Researchers and Scientists a modular and **adaptive** approach to a variety of NLP tasks with an
**Easy** API for training, inference, and deploying NLP-based microservices.
